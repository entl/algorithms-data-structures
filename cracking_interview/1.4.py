# Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check
# if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­ drome.
# A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards.
# A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.
# The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
